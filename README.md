> **A neuro-symbolic multi-agent platform autonomously orchestrating decisions across siloed enterprise departments.**

## 📖 Overview
Enterprise organizations often operate in isolated silos (Sales, Finance, Logistics), delaying cross-functional responses to market volatility. This project replaces stagnant, descriptive reporting with a **Multi-Agent Decision Engine**. 

By utilizing a centralized orchestrator and specialized domain agents, the platform actively breaks down data silos, dynamically resolves inter-departmental conflicts (e.g., sales growth vs. budget caps), and provides real-time, prescriptive execution plans for human-on-the-loop approval.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Polyglot Microservices:** High-performance TypeScript API gateway handling real-time client sync, coupled with Python-based AI microservices for heavy computation.
* **Autonomous Cross-Domain Negotiation:** Specialized AI agents debate and resolve conflicting departmental goals in milliseconds.
* **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture:** Fuses LLM-based reasoning (Google ADK) with deterministic Machine Learning models (Prophet/XGBoost) for zero-hallucination forecasting.
* **Prescriptive Command Center:** An interactive, role-based Next.js dashboard that visualizes agent reasoning and requires 1-click human approval for massive operational changes.
* **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Built-in Zero-Trust framework with role-based access control (RBAC) and immutable audit logging.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **API Gateway & Core Backend (Node.js/TypeScript):** Manages user authentication, database CRUD operations, and real-time streams for the frontend dashboard.
2. **AI & Orchestration Engine (Python/FastAPI):** Built with Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), this microservice houses the AI agents, manages LLM state, and executes deterministic ML pipelines.
3. **Domain Agents (The Specialists):**
   * `Sales Agent`: Analyzes CRM data and forecasts demand.
   * `Inventory Agent`: Monitors stock levels and proposes reorder quantities.
   * `Finance Agent`: Tracks cash flow and enforces budget constraints.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **AI & Orchestration:** Google Gemini (Vertex AI), Google ADK (Agent Development Kit).
* **AI Backend Microservice:** Python, FastAPI.
* **Core Backend Microservice:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express (or NestJS), WebSockets.
* **Deterministic ML:** Prophet, Scikit-Learn.
* **Data & Memory:** PostgreSQL (Audit/RBAC), Redis (Agent Session State & Message Broker).
* **Frontend:** Next.js, React.
* **Deployment:** Docker, Google Cloud Run / Vertex AI Agent Engine.
